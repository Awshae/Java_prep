#  Java Training Repository

This repository documents my learning journey through core Java programming concepts from basic syntaxes to object oriented programming.

---

## Overview

The repository is organized into the following concepts:

- Java Basics
- Control Structures (Conditionals and Loops)
- Methods and Type Casting
- Arrays and String Manipulation
- Exception Handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

---
## Topics Covered
### Java Basics
- Syntax and structure
- Data types, tokens, keywords, identifiers, literals, separators
- Operators: Arithmetic, relational, logical, increment/decrement, conditional (ternary)

### Control Structures
- Conditional statements: `if`, `if-else`, `if-else-if`, `switch`
- Loops: `for`, `while`, `do-while`
- Pattern printing using nested loops

### Methods
- Defining and invoking methods
- Methods with and without parameters
- Methods with return values
- Use in logic, arithmetic operations, and pattern generation

### Type Casting
- Widening (implicit casting)
- Narrowing (explicit casting)

### Strings and Exceptions
- String manipulation and operations
- Introduction to exception handling

### Arrays
- Array operations and element processing
- Searching techniques

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
- Object creation and manipulation
- Core OOP concepts:
  - Abstraction
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
